# A11yRabbit
🐰 Dockerized RabbitMQ for EqualifyApp 🐰

[![🏗️📤 Build and publish 🐳 images](https://github.com/EqualifyApp/a11y-rabbit/actions/workflows/containerize.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EqualifyApp/a11y-rabbit/actions/workflows/containerize.yml)

A11yRabbit is a pre-configured Docker image that provides RabbitMQ server for the EqualifyApp. This documentation explains how to use A11yRabbit and how to manage its queues, ports, volumes, and accounts.



## Usage

This Docker image provides a pre-configured RabbitMQ server for EqualifyApp. To use A11yRabbit, simply run the container to start the server. The RabbitMQ management console is available at http://localhost:15672 using the default username and password (guest/guest).

```sh
docker run -d --name a11y-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 equalifyapp/a11y-rabbit
```


## Queues
RabbitMQ is being used to manage queues for various types of scans and crawls performed by the gova11y system. The queues are organized by their function, with launch_ queues being used to hold URLs and data ready for checks, landing_ queues storing the results of those checks, and oops queues holding error messages from the system.

All queues are durable and have a message time-to-live of 7200000 milliseconds (2 hours).

### `launch_` Queues
The launch_ queues hold URLs and data ready for checks performed by the gova11y system. The queues are as follows:

| Queue Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `launch_axe` | Axe accessibility scanner |
| `launch_tech` | Wappalyzer tech check |
| `launch_uppies` | Site header and reachability check |
| `launch_crawler` | Kraken site crawler |
| `launch_crawler_sitemap` | Sitemap crawler |

All queues are durable, meaning that they will persist through server restarts, and have a message time-to-live of 7200000 milliseconds (2 hours).

### `landing_` Queues
The landing_ queues hold the results of the checks performed by the gova11y system. The queues are as follows:

| Queue Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `landing_axe` | Result of the axe accessibility scan |
| `landing_tech` | Result of the Wappalyzer tech check |
| `landing_uppies` | Result of the site header and reachability check |
| `landing_crawler` | Result of the Kraken site crawler |
| `landing_crawler_sitemap` | Result of the sitemap crawler |

All queues are durable, meaning that they will persist through server restarts, and have a message time-to-live of 7200000 milliseconds (2 hours).

### `oops` Queues
The oops queues hold error messages generated by the gova11y system. The queues are as follows:

| Queue Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `oops_matrix` | Errors from the Matrix |
| `oops_workers` | Errors from the workers |
| `oops_hole` | Insert worker results into PostgreSQL |


## Ports & Volumes
RabbitMQ is a messaging broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It uses ports and volumes to communicate and store data.


### Ports
The following are the ports used by RabbitMQ:

| Port   | Purpose                                                                                                     |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4369   | Used for the Erlang Distribution Protocol, which is used by RabbitMQ for clustering and node communication. |
| 5672   | Default AMQP port used by RabbitMQ for client connections. Applications use this port to send and receive messages. |
| 15672  | Used for the RabbitMQ management interface. It provides a web-base interface to manage and monitor RabbitMQ. |
| 15692  | Used for RabbitMQ's Prometheus exporter. It exposes metrics about RabbitMQ in a format that can be consumed by Prometheus or other monitoring systems. The exporter is enabled by the rabbitmq_prometheus plugin. |


### Volumes

**/var/lib/rabbitmq**: This volume contains RabbitMQ's data directory. It includes queues, exchanges, messages, and other data that RabbitMQ uses to store its state. You can mount this volume to persist RabbitMQ's data across container restarts.

## Accounts & Permissions
The system has a single vhost named gova11y. The permissions section specifies the access permissions for each user for this vhost. All users have full permissions (configure, write, and read) for all queues in the gova11y vhost.

| Username                 | Password                  | Purpose                                                 | Permissions                               |

| `worker_uppies`          | `pass_the_uppies_please`  | `uppies` check worker nodes                            | `configure`, `write`, `read`              |
| `rabbit_hole`            | `lets_insert_things`      | Rabbit hole for inserting `landing_` queues into PostgreSQL | `configure`, `write`, `read`        |

| `worker_crawler_sitemap` | `explore_the_unknown`     | Sitemap crawler nodes                                   | `configure`, `write`, `read`              |
